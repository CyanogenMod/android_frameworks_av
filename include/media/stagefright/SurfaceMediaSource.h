// ASSUMPTIONS
// 1. SurfaceMediaSource is initialized with width*height which
// can never change.  However, deqeueue buffer does not currently
// enforce this as in BufferQueue, dequeue can be used by Surface
// which can modify the default width and heght.  Also neither the width
// nor height can be 0.
// 2. setSynchronousMode is never used (basically no one should call
// setSynchronousMode(false)
// 3. setCrop, setTransform, setScalingMode should never be used
// 4. queueBuffer returns a filled buffer to the SurfaceMediaSource. In addition, a
// timestamp must be provided for the buffer. The timestamp is in
// nanoseconds, and must be monotonically increasing. Its other semantics
// (zero point, etc) are client-dependent and should be documented by the
// client.
// 5. Once disconnected, SurfaceMediaSource can be reused (can not
// connect again)
// 6. Stop is a hard stop, the last few frames held by the encoder
// may be dropped.  It is possible to wait for the buffers to be
// returned (but not implemented)
