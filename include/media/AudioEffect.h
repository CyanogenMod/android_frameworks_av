    /* Constructor.
     * AudioEffect is the base class for creating and controlling an effect engine from
     * the application process. Creating an AudioEffect object will create the effect engine
     * in the AudioFlinger if no engine of the specified type exists. If one exists, this engine
     * will be used. The application creating the AudioEffect object (or a derived class like
     * Reverb for instance) will either receive control of the effect engine or not, depending
     * on the priority parameter. If priority is higher than the priority used by the current
     * effect engine owner, the control will be transfered to the new application. Otherwise
     * control will remain to the previous application. In this case, the new application will be
     * notified of changes in effect engine state or control ownership by the effect callback.
     * After creating the AudioEffect, the application must call the initCheck() method and
     * check the creation status before trying to control the effect engine (see initCheck()).
     * If the effect is to be applied to an AudioTrack or MediaPlayer only the application
     * must specify the audio session ID corresponding to this player.

     * uuid:  Uuid of effect created: can be null if type is specified. This uuid corresponds to
     *        a particular implementation of an effect type.
     * priority:    requested priority for effect control: the priority level corresponds to the
     *      value of priority parameter: negative values indicate lower priorities, positive values
     *      higher priorities, 0 being the normal priority.
     * cbf:         optional callback function (see effect_callback_t)
     * user:        pointer to context for use by the callback receiver.
     * sessionID:   audio session this effect is associated to.
     *      If equal to AUDIO_SESSION_OUTPUT_MIX, the effect will be global to
     *      the output mix.  Otherwise, the effect will be applied to all players
     *      (AudioTrack or MediaPLayer) within the same audio session.
