 * This class is used to feed OMX codecs from a Surface via BufferQueue.
 *
 * Instances of the class don't run on a dedicated thread.  Instead,
 * various events trigger data movement:
 *
 *  - Availability of a new frame of data from the BufferQueue (notified
 *    via the onFrameAvailable callback).
 *  - The return of a codec buffer (via OnEmptyBufferDone).
 *  - Application signaling end-of-stream.
 *  - Transition to or from "executing" state.
 *
 * Frames of data (and, perhaps, the end-of-stream indication) can arrive
 * before the codec is in the "executing" state, so we need to queue
 * things up until we're ready to go.
